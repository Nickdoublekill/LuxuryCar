            <h1>Premium compact / Subcompact executive</h1>     
            <p>
              <p>The premium compact class is the category of the smallest luxury cars. It became popular in the mid-2000s, when European manufacturers— such as Audi, Volvo, BMW, and Mercedes-Benz— introduced new entry-level models that were smaller and cheaper than their compact executive models.The premium compact cars are usually based on the platform of a compact car (also known as "small family car" or C-segment), while some models may be based on a subcompact car (also known as supermini or B-segment).

               <br> Examples include the Mercedes-Benz A-Class and CLA-Class, Audi A3, Volvo S40, BMW 1 Series, and 2 Series. Premium compacts compete with well-equipped mid-size cars, and highly optioned premium compact cars can have pricing and features that overlaps with compact executive cars.</p>

            <h1>Compact executive / compact luxury</h1>     
            <p>
              <p>A compact executive car or a compact luxury car is a premium car larger than a premium compact and smaller than an executive car. In European classification, compact executive cars are part of the D-segment. In North American terms, close equivalents are "compact premium car", "compact luxury car", "entry-level luxury car" and "near-luxury car".Compact executive cars are usually based on the platform of a mid-size car (also known as large family car or D-segment), while some models may be based on a compact car (also known as small family car or C-segment).

            <h1>Executive / mid-size luxury</h1>     
            <p>
              <p>Executive car is a British term for an automobile larger than a large family car. In official use, the term is adopted by Euro NCAP, a European organization founded to test for car safety. It is a passenger car classification defined by the European Commission.</p>

            <h1>Luxury saloon / full-size luxury sedan</h1>     
            <p>
              <p>The next category of luxury cars is known in Great Britain as a "luxury saloon" or "luxury limousine,"and is known in the United States as a full-size luxury sedan, large luxury sedan, or flagship sedan.It is the equivalent of the European F-segment and German Oberklasse segment.

                Many of these luxury saloons are the flagship for the marque and include the newest automotive technology. Several models are available in long-wheelbase versions, which provide additional rear legroom and may have a higher level of standard features.
                
                Examples of luxury saloons / full-size luxury sedans include the BMW 7 Series,Jaguar XJ, Cadillac CT6, Genesis G90,Audi A8, Mercedes-Benz S-Class, Lexus LS, and Maserati Quattroporte.</p>

            <h1>Ultra-luxury</h1>     
            <p>
              <p>Luxury cars costing over US$100,000 (as of 2007) can be considered as "ultra-luxury cars".Examples include the Rolls-Royce Phantom, Maybach 57 and 62, Hongqi L5, Bentley Mulsanne, Toyota Century and Aurus Senat.High-end sports cars which are targeted towards performance rather than luxury are not usually classified as ultra-luxury cars, even when their cost is greater than US$100,000. The history of a brand and the exclusivity of a particular model can result in price premiums compared to luxury cars with similar features from less prestigious manufacturers. Ultra-luxury cars are usually selected as the official state car.</p>

            <h1>Luxury SUV/Crossover</h1>     
            <p>
              <p>Long before the luxury SUV segment became popular in the 1990s, the vehicle in this segment was the 1966 Jeep Super Wagoneer, which was marketed at the time as a station wagon. It was the first off-road SUV to offer a V8 engine and automatic transmission along with luxury car trim and equipment.Standard features included bucket seating, a center console, air conditioning, a seven-position tilt steering wheel, a vinyl roof, and gold-colored trim panels on the body sides and tailgate.By the late 1970s, optional equipment included an electric sunroof.The 1978 Jeep Wagoneer Limited was the spiritual successor to the Super Wagoneer and was the first four-wheel drive car to use leather upholstery.
                
                <p>Another early luxury SUV is the Range Rover. Released in 1970 as a two-door and a four-door version in 1981, the model was pushed upmarket in 1983 by introducing an automatic transmission (Chrysler's A727 TorqueFlite) as an option.The Range Rover had a long-travel coil-spring suspension and an aluminium V8 engine.
                
                <p>In the mid-1990s, the SUV market expanded with new entrants. By the mid-1990s, the entry-level Ford Explorer and upscale Jeep Grand Cherokee were the market leaders for SUVs. The fastest-growing sector of this market was for the so-called luxury SUVs, which included the Jeep Grand Cherokee ... the Grand Cherokee's allure: "This vehicle is proof you can have a true off-road vehicle without giving up luxuries and amenities" with the Jeep providing a crucial new intangible factor for buyers.
                
                <p>The SUV models generated higher profit margins than passenger cars, and car manufacturers began introducing new luxury SUVs during the late 1990s.SUVs such as the 1995 Lexus LX, 1997 Mercedes-Benz M-Class, and 1998 Lincoln Navigator were the first SUVs produced by these luxury car brands. Some of these early luxury SUV models used unibody construction, becoming part of the trend moving away from the body-on-frame construction traditionally used by off-road vehicles.
                
                <p>During the mid-2000s, SUVs from luxury car brands grew at almost 40% in the United States to more than 430,000 vehicles (excluding SUV-only brands like Hummer and Land Rover), at a time when luxury car sales suffered a 1% decline, and non-luxury SUV sales were flat. By 2004, 30% of major luxury brands' U.S. sales were SUVs. Crossover SUVs became increasingly popular in the mid-2000s, and manufacturers also began to produce luxury versions of crossovers. The Lexus RX was the earliest luxury crossover on the market, and it has since been the best-selling luxury vehicle in the US.[110] Some luxury crossovers are built on a platform shared with sedans or hatchbacks. For example, the Infiniti FX is based upon the same platform as the Infiniti G35 sedans and coupes.While early luxury crossovers released in the late 1990s have resembled traditional boxy SUVs, later crossovers, such as the Infiniti FX and BMW X6, have been designed with a sporting appearance.
                
                <p>Despite the increased popularity of crossover models, traditional luxury SUVs remain in production. Examples include the Lexus LX, Infiniti QX80, and Lincoln Navigator.
                
                <p>Data from the mid-2000s suggested that luxury SUV buyers did not consider traditional luxury cars (e.g. sedans and coupes), therefore the SUV is becoming the key to bringing new customers to the luxury dealerships.
                
                <p>Luxury car companies have increasingly introduced SUV or crossover models in the 2010s. For example, Rolls-Royce Cullinan, Bentley Bentayga, Aston Martin DBX, Maserati Levante, and Lamborghini Urus. Some brands, such as Lincoln, have even moved to an all SUV and/or crossover lineup.</p>
