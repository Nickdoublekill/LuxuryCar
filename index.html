            <h1>Luxury Car</h1>
            <p>
                A luxury car is a car that provides increased price levels of comfort, equipment, amenities, quality, performance, and associated status compared to moderately priced cars.
                <br> term is subjective and reflects both the qualities of the car and the brand image of its manufacturer.Luxury brands rank above premium brands, though there is no fixed demarcation between the two.
      
                <br>Traditionally, most luxury cars were large vehicles, though smaller sports-oriented models were always produced. "Compact" luxury vehicles such as hatchbacks, and off-road capable sport utility vehicles, are relatively modern trends.
